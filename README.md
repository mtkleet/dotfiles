# dotfiles

Personal development-environment preferences. Using this configuration in ArcoLinux, WSL2, and Termux.

## How to install on Linux: 
1. Create backup of your current (neo)vim and zsh rc-files.
2. Make sure you've got working ```wget``` binary in your ```$PATH```.
3. Run in terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/g4cm4n/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh
```

\(Optional\) If you have superuser rights you can remove ```.zshenv``` from your ```$HOME``` to keep it clean as good practice suggests. Instead set ```ZDOTDIR=$HOME/.zsh``` in ```/etc/zsh/zshenv```.

## Instructions for WSL: 
1. Copy contents of ```dotfiles\windows\%USERPROFILE%\.config\Fonts``` to ```C:\Windows\Fonts```.
2. Copy ```dotfiles\windows\%USERPROFILE%\.config\ProfileIcons\``` to ```C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\.config\ProfileIcons```.
3. Replace Windows Terminal settings (CTRL+,) with [this provided in repo](https://github.com/g4cm4n/dotfiles/blob/master/windows/settings.json).
4. Customize options which are different \(unique\) for every W10/WSL environment like ```startingDirectory```, ```keybindings```, etc...
4. Run ```bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh``` inside your WSL distro.
5. Restart prompt.

My theme of choice is [Solarized Dark](https://github.com/altercation/solarized).
However, I included many different schemes in [my settings.json](https://github.com/g4cm4n/dotfiles/blob/master/windows/settings.json). If you decide to use another one, remeber about installing according zsh-dircolors as well.

If you want to achieve similar look for [posh](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) or cmd, inspect files inside ```dotfiles\windows```. Try to adapt them to your environment, as my config has many dependencies. Most of them can be installed with the help of [scoop: command line installer for windows](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop). Bare in mind, these settings are experimental and I frequently change them along with development progression of [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL) and [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal). Surely though, with improved interoperability between Win10 and WSL2, in the near future it should be possible to optimize them easily and eliminate most exisiting annoyances/issues.
